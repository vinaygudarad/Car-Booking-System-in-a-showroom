# Car-Booking-System-in-a-showroom

1.	Introduction

	1.1	Overview of the  problem statement
The problem statement which we have chosen is regarding the Car Booking system in a showroom. The customers should be able to see the details of different types of vehicles available and the details of the vehicle. The customer thereafter should be able to book the desired vehicle. After the completion of booking the vehicle by a customer, the admin must be able to see the details of all the bookings.
The project should also be able to provide the admin to add a vehicle to the directory when a new vehicle comes and the admin must be able to add employee details to the directory. The admin should have the access to view all booking history, branch details like number of vehicles and employees present in the showroom and the number of bookings done. The project should also be able to handle any types of errors like accessing any empty directory i.e., when no record is present in the directory.
